## About
I build and validate small, reproducible AWS environments. I focus on practical infra skills: EC2 provisioning, ALB path-based routing, VPC/networking, simple automation (user-data / AWS CLI), and basic monitoring (CloudWatch). I convert web apps into cloud-ready deployments and document reproducible steps so others can reproduce or extend them.
